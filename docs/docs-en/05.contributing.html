    <p>
      Thank you for considering contributing to the Index Page Generator! Your contributions are highly appreciated.
    </p>

    <h2>üîß How to Contribute</h2>

    <h3>1. Fork the Repository</h3>
    <p>
      Fork the <a href="https://github.com/JohnFilipstad/index-page-generator">repository</a> to your own GitHub account. This will create your own copy of the project where you can make changes without affecting the original project.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Clone Your Fork</h3>
    <p>
      Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/JohnFilipstad/index-page-generator.git</code></pre>

    <h3>3. Create a New Branch</h3>
    <p>
      Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix. It's good practice to use a descriptive name for your branch:
    </p>
    <pre><code>git checkout -b my-feature-branch</code></pre>

    <h3>4. Make Your Changes</h3>
    <p>
      Make the necessary changes to the codebase. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Commit Your Changes</h3>
    <p>
      Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message:
    </p>
    <pre><code>git commit -m "Add new feature to improve performance"</code></pre>

    <h3>6. Push to Your Fork</h3>
    <p>
      Push your changes to your forked repository:
    </p>
    <pre><code>git push origin my-feature-branch</code></pre>

    <h3>7. Submit a Pull Request</h3>
    <p>
      Go to the original repository and open a pull request with a detailed description of your changes and any relevant issue numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by the maintainers. They may ask for changes before it is merged into the main project.
